    "For our purposes, the key thing to know is that the draft lottery primarily affected men who (1) were born between 1944 and 1950, (2) had not yet enlisted in the military, and (3) had previously received a deferral due to being in college. The lottery itself gave a random \"ranking\" to all dates of birth, i.e., each DOB was given a lottery number from 1 to 366. (See what your draft number would have been <a href='http://history.hanover.edu/pictures2/1969-1202-madcour-p2-lottery.jpg'>here</a>!) Those who were born on a date with a lower number were more likely to be drafted, though whether this actually happened depended on several other factors. For example, some would have been ruled ineligible for service for medical reasons, or lived in places that already filled quotas for the number of men to enlist.\n",

    "The slope you get from this should be the same as what you got question 3.2. This is reassuring: once we normalize the lottery number to be between 0 and 1, the slope tells us the change in the prediction of war attitudes as `lotnum01` goes up by one unit (i.e., the lowest to highest value). In other words, the change in predicted war attitude as we go from the lowest to highest lottery number isn't affected by whether we use the \"raw number\" or 0 to 1 version. \n",

Erikson and Stoker argue that for the case of political attitudes, it may make more sense to think about the lottery number itself as causing the change in attitudes, since having a low lottery number could induce fear/anxiety about getting drafted regardless of whether that actually happens.\n",

Use `smf.ols` to run this regression. (Recall for multivariate regression the \"formula\" argument should look like `DV ~ IV1 + IV2`.)**"

Economists and other social scientists often use the natural log of wages rather than the \"raw\" measure of wages for reasons we'll discuss in a few weeks. For now, the important thing to know is that we can interpret the coefficient as telling us the *percent increase* in wage as education goes up by one year."
